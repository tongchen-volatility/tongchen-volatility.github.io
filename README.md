## CHEN TONG（童晨）

**Welcome to my homepage!**
- Chen Tong is an assistant professor at the Department of Finance, Xiamen University, China. He holds a B.S. in Chemistry, a B.A. in Economics, and a Ph.D. in Finance from Peking University, China.
- He focuses on the modeling of financial <em>volatility</em>, high-frequency data analysis, and their applications in financial engineering. Some of his main contributions are associated with developing new high-frequency-based pricing models for VIX derivatives (e.g., VIX futures/options), and proposing coherent frameworks for derivatives pricing with time-varying risk aversion.
- Another line of his research is related to economic <em>uncertainty</em>, including constructing China’s macro/financial uncertainty indexes and investigating the theoretical/empirical relations between uncertainty and volatility.
- He is currently collaborating with his overseas advisor [@Peter Reinhard Hansen](https://sites.google.com/site/peterreinhardhansen/) on exploring parameterizations of structured correlation matrices and their practical use in building advanced GARCH models for high-dimensional data.
- Chen would like to talk/cooperate with all researchers/students who have common research interests.
