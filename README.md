## CHEN TONG（童晨）

**Welcome to my homepage!**
- Chen Tong is an assistant professor at the Department of Finance, Xiamen University, China. He holds a B.S. in Chemistry, a B.A. in Economics, and a Ph.D. in Finance from Peking University, China.
- He focuses on the modeling of financial <em>volatility/covariance matrix</em>, high-frequency data analysis, and their applications in financial engineering. Some of his main contributions are associated with developing new high-dimensional multivariate GARCH models, high-frequency data based pricing models for VIX derivatives (e.g., VIX futures/options), and proposing coherent frameworks for derivatives pricing with time-varying risk aversion.
- Chen would like to talk/cooperate with all researchers/students who have common research interests.
